title: Version Control with Git
date: 2017-07-07
duration: 90

## Learning objectives

*  Configure `git` the first time is used on a computer.
*  Create a local Git repository
*  Understand the modify-add-commit cycle for a single file
*  Configure Git to ignore specific files.

## Getting started with Git

To learn about version control with Git, we are going to use the following scenario:

*Wolfman and Dracula have been hired by Universal Missions to investigate if it is **possible to send their planetary lander to Mars**. They want to be able to work on the plans at the same time, but they have run into problems doing this in the past. If they take turns, each one will spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish, but if they work on their own copies and email changes back and forth things will be lost, overwritten, or duplicated. Therefore, they are going to use Git with Github to work on their plans at the same time, then merge their changes.*

### Git configuration

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   to colorize our output,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project)

On a command line, Git commands are written as:

```bash
git verb
``` 
where `verb` is what we actually want to do. So here is how 
Dracula sets up his new laptop:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"

$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"

$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
~~~

(Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's.)

He also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| Text Wrangler      | `$ git config --global core.editor "edit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` > |
| Notepad++ (Win)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit -s -w"`   |
| emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |

The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can check your settings at any time:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git config --list
~~~

You can change your configuration as many times as you want: just use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

### Creating a local Git repository

Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.
Let's create a directory for our work and then move into that directory:

~~~ {.bash}
$ mkdir planets

$ cd planets
~~~

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository](../reference.html#repository)&mdash;a place where
Git can store versions of our files:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git init
~~~

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls
~~~

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls -a
~~~
~~~ {.output}
.	..	.git
~~~

Git stores information about the project in this special sub-directory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
~~~

***
**Exercise**

Dracula starts a new project, `moons`, related to his `planets` project. Despite Wolfman's concerns, he enters the following sequence of commands to create one Git repository inside another:
 
 ~~~ {.bash}
 cd             # return to home directory
 mkdir planets  # make a new directory planets
 cd planets     # go into planets
 git init       # make the planets directory a Git repository
 mkdir moons    # make a sub-directory planets/moons
 cd moons       # go into planets/moons
 git init       # make the moons sub-directory a Git repository
 ~~~
 
 Why is it a bad idea to do this?
 How can Dracula "undo" his last `git init`?
 
***

## Tracking changes with Git

Dracula creates a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.
(We'll use `nano` to create and edit the file; you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier.)

~~~ {.bash}
$ nano mars.txt
~~~

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~

`mars.txt` now contains a single line, which we can see by running:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	mars.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add mars.txt
~~~

and then check that the right thing happened:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   mars.txt


~~~

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars as a base
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
~~~

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit](../reference.html#commit)
(or [revision](../reference.html#revision)) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`
(Your commit may have another identifier.)

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `vim` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

Good commit messages start with a brief (<50 characters) summary of
changes made in the commit.  If you want to go into more detail, add
a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.


If we run `git status` now:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
~~~

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git log
~~~
~~~ {.output}
commit bb8481cb90e70befd5970dbffa78a40cd409943c (HEAD -> master)
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Apr 13 10:27:55 2023 -0400

    Start notes on Mars as a base
~~~

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file.

```{.bash}
$ nano mars.txt
```
Add the following line to the file, then save and quit:

~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
~~~

```{.bash}
$ cat mars.txt
```

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".

We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git diff
~~~
~~~ {.output}
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index d927c56..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
-
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
~~~

The output is cryptic, so let's break it down:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` markers in the first column show where we have added lines.

After reviewing/approving our change, it's time to commit it:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[master f42ded2] Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything
because we may not want to commit everything at once.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work
to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding addition to the bibliography,
but *not* commit the work we're doing on the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [change set](../reference.html#change-set)
but not yet committed.

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll add another line to the file:

```{.bash}
$ nano mars.txt
```

~~~ {.output}

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add mars.txt
$ git diff
~~~

There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.
However,

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

### Ignoring files during tracking

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,
like backup files created by our editor
or intermediate files created during data analysis. Generally, it's a good idea to avoid versioning really large files and binary files; however, Git does have an [extension](https://git-lfs.github.com/) you can download if you need to version these types of files.

Let's practice with ignoring files by creating a few dummy files:

~~~ {.bash}
$ mkdir results
$ touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
~~~

and see what Git says:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	a.dat
	b.dat
	c.dat
	results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.
What's worse is that having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,
so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

```{.bash}
$ nano .gitignore
```

~~~ {.output}
*.dat
results/
~~~

```{.bash}
$ cat .gitignore
```

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.dat`
and everything in the `results` directory.
(If any of these files were already being tracked,
Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file,
the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.
You might think we wouldn't want to track it,
but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore
the same things that we're ignoring.
Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Add the ignore file"
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[master c22074d] Add the ignore file
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
~~~

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding to the repository files that we don't want to track:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git add a.dat
~~~
~~~ {.output}
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.dat
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"
~~~

If we really want to override our ignore settings,
we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something.
We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status --ignored
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
Ignored files:
  (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	a.dat
	b.dat
	c.dat
	results/

nothing to commit, working tree clean
~~~

***
**Exercises**

1. Given a directory structure that looks like:
	~~~ {.bash}
	results/data
	results/plots
	~~~

	How would you ignore only `results/plots` and not `results/data`?

2. How would you ignore all `.data` files in your root directory except for `final.data`? *Hint: Check Google for what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does*

## Comparing differences between files

If we want to see what we changed at different steps, we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to old
commits:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index 315bf3a..b36abfd 100644

+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@

-
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
+But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1` (pronounced "head minus one")
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and letters that `git log` displays. These are unique IDs for the changes, and "unique" really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any computer has a unique 40-character identifier. My first commit was given the ID bb8481cb90e70befd5970dbffa78a40cd409943c. 

What was the ID of your first commit? Once you have that let's try this:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git diff <ID-of-first-commit> mars.txt

That's the right answer, but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying, so Git lets us use just the first few characters (5 or more should work!):

## Recovering older versions of a file

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changed&mdash;now how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file trying to extract a specific line:

```{.bash}
$ grep appreciate mars.txt > mars.txt 
```

~~~ {.bash}
$ cat mars.txt
~~~

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git status
~~~
~~~ {.output}
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~

We can put things back the way they were by using `git checkout`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~

As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.

If we want to go back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git checkout <first-6-characters-of-ID> mars.txt
~~~

> ### Don't lose your HEAD
> Above we used to revert mars.txt to its state after the first commit.

It's important to remember that we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository *before* the change we're trying to undo. A common mistake is to use the number of the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of. 

### "Recovering" newer versions of a file
	
If you accidentally went too far back when you tried to recover an older version of a file, don't worry! The newer version of the file still has a commit ID associated with it and you can return to it. `git log` will give you a list of all the commits, prior to and ahead of the version you are currently on (if they exist). You can redo the `git checkout` to come back to the newer version if you choose to.

So, to put it all together:

The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

**Exercises**

(1) Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working on for weeks, and the modifications she made this morning "broke" the script and it no longer runs. She has spent ~ 1hr trying to fix it, with no luck...
Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git! 

Which of the options below will let her recover the last committed version of her Python script called `data_cruncher.py`?
	
a. `$ git checkout HEAD`

b. `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py`

c. `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`

d. `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`

e. Both b & d


(2) What is the output of `cat venus.txt` at the end of this set of commands?

```bash
$ cd planets
$ vim venus.txt #input the following text: Venus is beautiful and full of love
$ git add venus.txt
$ vim venus.txt #add the following text: Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
$ git commit -m "comments on Venus as an unsuitable base"
$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt
$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen
```

a. `Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base`

b. `Venus is beautiful and full of love`

c. `Venus is beautiful and full of love`

`Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base`

d. Error because you have changed venus.txt without committing the change
